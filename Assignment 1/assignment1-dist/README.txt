# Assignment 1: Introduction

Student name: 
Student number: 
Hours spent on requirements (approx.): 20 hours
Hours spent on extra credit (approx.): 5 hours

# First, some questions about where you come from and how you got started.
# Your answers in this section will be used to improve the course.
# They will not be judged or affect your points, but please answer all of them.
# Keep it short; answering shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.

- What are you studying here at Aalto? (Department, major, minor...?)
I major in Human Computer Interaction at the department of Science.
- Which year of your studies is this?
First year.
- Is this a mandatory course for you?
No.

- Have you had something to do with graphics before? Other studies, personal interests, work?
As a computer science student in my undergraduate years, I took the mandatory course Computer Graphics. But it focused more on math and theory, and I am really interested in the beautiful and cool output. So I am here to practice and create it by myself!

- Do you remember basic linear algebra? Matrix and vector multiplication, cross product, that sort of thing?
Yes.

- How is your overall programming experience? What language are you most comfortable with?
I took the C and C++ courses systematically, and experienced with java and python required for course projects by self-learning. In daily coding, C++, Python and Javascript are the most frequently used.

- Do you have some experience with these things? (If not, do you have experience with something similar such as C or Direct3D?)
C++: Yes.
C++11: Yes.
OpenGL: A little.

- Have you used a version control system such as Git, Mercurial or Subversion? Which ones?
Yes, I used Git.
- Did you go to the technology lecture?
Yes.
- Did you go to exercise sessions?
Yes.
- Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both?
Both.

# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

(Try to get everything done! Based on previous data, virtually everyone who put in the work and did well in the first two assignments ended up finishing the course, and also reported a high level of satisfaction at the end of the course.)

                            opened this file (0p): done
                         R1 Moving an object (1p): done
R2 Generating a simple cone mesh and normals (3p): done
  R3 Converting mesh data for OpenGL viewing (3p): done
           R4 Loading a large mesh from file (3p): done

# Did you do any extra credit work?

(Describe what you did and, if there was a substantial amount of work involved, how you did it. Also describe how to use/activate your extra features, if they are interactive.)

Yes, I did. I used git for version management, without many commits as the log shows for the relative small tasks. And I realized rotate and scale transforms, responsive to Q/P and L/S keys separately. 


# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?

(Please provide a list of the problems. If possible, describe what you think the cause is, how you have attempted to diagnose or fix the problem, and how you would attempt to diagnose or fix it if you had more time or motivation. This is important: we are more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.)

No bugs remaining now. But there were some problem before:
1) .gitignore file
In my computer with VS2019, .sdf for intellisense has been replaced by .VC.db. So I added *.VC.db and *.opendb to the .gitignore file.
2) z-axis orientation question
As the example runs, PgUp key means moving into the screen, but the z-value increased.


# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?

(Did you help others? Did others help you? Let us know who you talked to, and what sort of help you gave or received.)

Not yet now. Because most of the bugs and puzzles could be fixed by debugging with checkpoints or searching online. Next I will make use of the forum.


# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)

It is a very good introduction assignment for me. I learned operations about 3D models preliminarily, including generating, drawing and moving by practicing. Probably more material about the extra credit part can help me learn it faster. Looking forward to Assignment2! :D
